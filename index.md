## Puzzlet - Description
```markdown
 4 Person Team, Role: Lead Programmer  
 Time Frame: 5 weeks 
 The Goal for this game was to create an alternate way of playing in contrast
 to the more traditional Setups of Console or computer. Puzzlet, was based off 
 of escape rooms and was designed with that concept in mind. We started with
 Unity as a base for the engine, and worked our way up from there. My entire 
 Job was to implement a basic Networking system so that puzzles could interact 
 with each other.

## AI Bomberman - Description
```markdown
2 Person Team, Role: Programmer  
Time Frame: 2 weeks 
As a Final Assignment we had to create a game that implemented things we had 
learned from class such as AI steering, pathfinding, and state machines. We 
Implemented theses systems with a starting code base that needed heavy 
refactoring and messaging to work and created a prototype for bomberman where
the ai is slightly more intimidating.
