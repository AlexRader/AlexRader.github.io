## Puzzlet - Description
```markdown
 4 Person Team, Role: **Lead Programmer**  
 Time Frame: 5 weeks 
 The Goal for this game was to create an alternate way of playing in contrast to the more traditional Setups of Console or computer. Puzzlet, was based off of escape rooms and was designed with that concept in mind. We started with Unity as a base for the engine, and worked our way up from there. My entire Job was to implement a basic Networking system so that puzzles could interact with each other.

```markdown
2 Person Team, Role: **Programmer**  
Time Frame: 2 weeks 
As a Final Assignment we had to create a game that implemented things we had learned from class such as AI steering, pathfinding, and state machines. We Implemented theses systems with a starting code base that needed heavy refactoring and messaging to work and created a prototype for bomberman where the ai is slightly more intimidating.
