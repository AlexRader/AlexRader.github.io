## Where's The Wolf
```markdown
Solo Team, Role: 
Time Frame: 15 weeks 
The goal for this game was to Start from scratch using Unity to 
make a 2D game based off of past Ludum Dare prompts such as
Minimalistic, You Are the Monster, etc. Where's The Wolf Is an 
action arcade game where the primary Goal is slaughter civilians.
This game was a good skill building exercise for me and my unity 
skills. I also gained tons of understanding and appreciation for
all the other game production roles.

## AI Bomberman - Description
```markdown
2 Person Team, Role: Lead Programmer
Time Frame: 2 weeks 
As a Final Assignment we had to create a game that implemented
things we had learned from class such as AI steering, pathfinding, 
and state machines. We Implemented these systems with a starting 
code base that needed heavy refactoring and messaging to work and 
created a prototype for Bomberman where the AI is slightly more 
intimidating. I was primarily in charge of the editor, level and
asset loading and underlying gids and graphs as well as steering.

## Puzzlet
```markdown
 4 Person Team, Role: Lead Programmer  
 Time Frame: 5 weeks 
 The Goal for this game was to create an alternate way of playing 
 in contrast to the more traditional Setups of console or 
 computer. Puzzlet, was based off of escape rooms and was 
 designed with that concept in mind. We started with Unity as a 
 base for the engine, and worked our way up from there. My entire 
 Job was to implement a basic Networking system so that puzzles 
 could interact with each other.

## Rainbow Bounce
```markdown
 2 Person Team, Role: Lead Programmer, QA person
 Time Frame: 2 weeks 
 My first true production game it is a relatively simple one 
 button game. holding space moves the player, a tripple press
 will change the ball's color. This is my base benchmark for
 my Unity 2D games.
